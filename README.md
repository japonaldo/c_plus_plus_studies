# C++ Playland Place

**WARNING!!! This is literally a playland place... Hence, there is no intention of writting any well structured code in this repo.**

The intention of this repo is only to provide me a place to perform code tryouts, "play" with new features and document new acquired knowledge.

Basically, this is a "cheating" place which helps me to freshen up my mind to "find" the knowledge that might be lost in my mind :laughing:

So, don't judge the book by its cover... just be relaxed and enjoy life!
